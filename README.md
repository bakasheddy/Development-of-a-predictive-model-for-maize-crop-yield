Hate speech remains a pervasive societal issue within digital spaces, posing significant challenges to online safety and fostering inclusive environments. This project addresses this critical concern by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to develop an innovative hate speech detection system. The foundation of this work lies in the nuanced understanding of hate speech nuances within diverse contexts, targeting specific social groups based on attributes like race, gender, religion, and sexual orientation. To ensure a comprehensive and robust dataset, meticulous data augmentation was conducted using back translation facilitated by the deep-translator library, enriching the dataset's diversity and size.
Employing a hybridized approach, this project amalgamates the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) attention mechanisms and a context analyzer to capture intricate contextual relationships within textual data. This fusion enables a deeper analysis of hate speech patterns and enhances the model's precision in distinguishing harmful content from legitimate expressions. The hate speech detection model was trained for 20 epochs, comprising two layers with a frozen BERT layer. The training utilized the Adam optimizer and employed softmax for classifying the multi-labeled classes of hate speech, this yielded the total accuracy of 0.99 on the 20th epoch.

The evaluation metrics of the trained model reveal promising performance: Macro Precision of 0.79875, Macro Recall of 0.71587, and Macro F1-score of 0.74825. Through meticulous pre-processing, tokenization, and model training, the system optimally processes textual data to create a resilient and efficient hate speech detection model. The utilization of the hybridized BERT attention mechanism not only identifies explicit hate speech but also detects subtle nuances and underlying meanings, providing a holistic understanding of harmful content. The integration of a context analyzer further refines the model's predictive capabilities, distinguishing genuine expressions from potentially harmful language and contributing significantly to online safety and inclusivity.
This project represents a significant stride towards combating online hate speech. By harnessing state-of-the-art NLP techniques, the project endeavors to create a sophisticated, context-aware hate speech detection system. The comprehensive approach, encompassing data augmentation, advanced modeling techniques, and context analysis, underscores the system's reliability and effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impact of hate speech online. The outcomes of this research not only contribute to ongoing efforts in curbing online toxicity but also pave the way for fostering respectful digital interactions and cultivating an empathetic and understanding online environment.
